Python solution to the ["Build Your Own Shell" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/shell/overview).

Challenge description: This challenge build your own POSIX compliant shell that's capable 
of interpreting shell commands, running external programs and builtin commands like cd, 
pwd, echo and more. Along the way, you'll learn about shell command parsing, REPLs, 
builtin commands, and more.
